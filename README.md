* Intel&reg; Atom&trade; Processor C2000

## Software Requirements

Successful operation of this release requires a software tool chain that
supports OpenSSL\* 1.1.0.
This release was validated on the following:

* Operating system: Fedora\* 16 64-bit version
* Kernel: GNU\*/Linux\* 3.1.0.7
* Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 895x Series Software for Linux\*, version 2.6

## Limitations

CAUTION: Please note that the software provided in this release is
"sample software" that is not fully functional or fully tested and
is known to contain bugs and errors. As such, Intel&reg; does not
recommend the use of the software in its current state for your
production use.

* When forking within an application it is not valid for
  a cryptographic operation to be started in the parent process,
  and completed in the child process.
* Only one level of forking is permitted, if a child process forks
  again then the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine will
  not be available in that forked process.

## Installation Instructions

### Build Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology Driver

Please follow the instructions contained in:

Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 89xx Series Software for Linux\* - Getting
Started Guide (330750)

or in

Intel&reg; Atom&trade; Processor C2000 Product Family for Communications
Infrastructure Software - Getting Started Guide (333035)

These instructions can be found on the 01.org website in the following
section:

<https://01.org/packet-processing/intel%C2%AE-quickassist-technology-drivers-and-patches>

### Build OpenSSL\*

Clone OpenSSL\* from Github\* at the following location:

    git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

It is recommended to checkout and build against the OpenSSL\* 1.1.0 git tag
specified in the release notes.
Older versions of OpenSSL\* are not supported.

Due to the nature of the Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology OpenSSL\*
Engine being a dynamic engine it can only be used with shared library
builds of OpenSSL\*.

Note: The OpenSSL\* 1.1.0 baseline builds as a shared library by default
now so there is no longer any need to specify the `shared` option when
running `./config`.

Note: It is not recommended to install the accelerated version of
OpenSSL\* as your default system library. If you do you may find that
acceleration is used unexpectedly by other applications on the system
resulting in undesired/unsupported behaviour. The `--prefix` can be used
with the `./config` command to specify the location that make install will
copy files to. Please see the OpenSSL\* INSTALL file for full details on
usage of the `--prefix` option.

The following example is assuming:

* The OpenSSL\* source was cloned from Github\* to its own location at
  the root of the drive: `/`.
* You want OpenSSL\* to be installed to `/usr/local/ssl`.

An example build would be:
```bash
cd /openssl
./config --prefix=/usr/local/ssl
make depend (if recommended by the OpenSSL* build system)
make
make install
```
As the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine will be built
as a dynamic engine it is important to
tell OpenSSL\* where to find the dynamic engines at runtime. This is
achieved by exporting the following environment variable (assuming the
example paths above):

    export OPENSSL_ENGINES=/usr/local/ssl/lib/engines-1.1

Note: This variable will need to be present in the environment whenever
the engine is used.

Further information on building OpenSSL\* can be found in the INSTALL
file distributed with the OpenSSL\* source code or on the official
OpenSSL\* Wiki in the Compilation and Installation section:
<https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation>

### Clone the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine

Clone the Github\* repository containing the Intel&reg; Quickassist
Technology OpenSSL\* Engine:

    git clone https://github.com/01org/QAT_Engine.git

The repository can be cloned to either a subdirectory within the OpenSSL\*
repository, for instance if the OpenSSL\* source is located at
`/openssl` then the engine could be cloned at `/openssl/engines`,
or to its own unique location on the file system, for instance within
`/`. In either case the engine will not be built as part of the OpenSSL\*
build and will require building manually.

### Build and install a contiguous memory driver

The Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology API requires many of the data
structures (those that will be passed to the hardware) to be allocated
in contiguous pinned memory in order to support DMA operations.
You must either supply your own contiguous memory driver and make
changes to the engine to make use of it or use one of the following
drivers:

#### (Optional) Build and load the example contiguous memory driver - qat\_contig\_mem

The Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine comes with an
example kernel space contiguous memory driver that can be used to try
out operation of the engine. It is considered to be an example only
and is not written to be a production quality driver.

The following example is assuming:
* The Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine was cloned to its
  own location at the root of the drive: `/`.

To build/install the qat\_contig\_mem driver follow these steps:

```bash
cd /QAT_Engine/qat_contig_mem
make
make load
make test
```

The expected output from `make test` should be something similar
to the following:

    seg mapped to 0x7f9eedd6e000, virtualAddress in seg 0xffff880ac9c0c000,
    length 64
    Hello world!
    # PASS Verify for QAT Contig Mem Test

#### (Optional) Load the User Space DMA-able Memory (USDM) Component

As an alternative the Upstream Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology Driver comes
with its own contiguous pinned memory driver that is compatible with the
Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine. The USDM component is of
a higher quality than the qat\_contig\_mem driver, and is the preferred option.
Unfortunately the USDM component may not be available if using older
Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology Driver versions. The USDM component is used
by the Upstream Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology Driver itself, and also
has the following additional features:

* Support for virtualization
* Support for configurable slab sizes
* Support for configurable secure freeing of memory (overwrite with zeros)
* Support for configurable slab caching

The USDM component is located within the Upstream Intel&reg; QuickAssist
Technology Driver source code in the following subdirectory:
`quickassist/utilities/libusdm_drv`.
As the USDM component is also used by the upstream driver itself it will
have already been built when the driver was built. It may also already
be loaded as well, and you can check by running `lsmod` and looking
for usdm_drv in the list. If not present it can be loaded as follows:

```bash
insmod ./usdm_drv.ko
```

### Build the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine

The following example is assuming:

* The Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine was cloned to its
  own location at the root of the drive: `/`.
* The Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology Driver was unpacked within
  `/QAT`.
* An Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series device is fitted.
* The OpenSSL\* source was cloned from Github\* to its own location at
  the root of the drive: `/`.
* OpenSSL\* was installed to `/usr/local/ssl`.

To build and install the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine:

```bash
cd /QAT_Engine
./configure \
--with-qat_dir=/QAT/QAT1.6 \
--with-openssl_dir=/openssl \
--with-openssl_install_dir=/usr/local/ssl
make
make install
```

In the above example this will create the file `qat.so` and
copy it to `/usr/local/ssl/lib/engines-1.1`.

Note: When building it is possible to specify command line options
that can be used to turn engine functionality on and off. Please see
the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine Build Options
section below for a full description of the options that can be
specified. The above options are all mandatory.

If you plan to link against the Upstream Intel&reg; Quickassist
Technology userspace shared library then there are some additional
options that may be required:

* The `--enable-upstream_driver` is a mandatory parameter to the
  `./configure` that tells the build that you are going to link against
  the upstream version of the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver
  and ensures the link step is setup correctly.
* The `--enable-usdm` is an optional parameter to the `./configure`
  that tells the build that it should be compiled to use the usdm
  component and that the link should be configured to link in the
  userspace library of the usdm component.

An example to build and install the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
OpenSSL\* Engine based on the example above, but building against the
Upstream Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver, and using the USDM
component would be as follows:

```bash
cd /QAT_Engine
./configure \
--with-qat_dir=/QAT \
--with-openssl_dir=/openssl \
--with-openssl_install_dir=/usr/local/ssl \
--enable-upstream_driver \
--enable-usdm
make
make install
```

### Copy the correct Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver config files

The Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine comes with some example
conf files to use with the Intel Quickassist Technology Driver.
The Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine will not function with
the default Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver conf file
because the default conf does not contain a `[SHIM]` section which the
Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine requires. The conf files are
located at:

    /path/to/qat_engine/qat/config

The files are grouped by acceleration device, please choose the files
appropriate to your acceleration device only.
If building to link against the Upstream Intel&reg; Quickassist
Technology userspace shared library then you should use the files in
`dh895xcc_upstream`

The files are also split into `multi_process_optimized` and
`multi_thread_optimized`.

If your application runs one (or very few) processes,
but has multiple threads in each process, each accessing the acceleration
device, then you should pick the `multi_thread_optimized` config files. An
example of this is a webserver that creates a new thread for each incoming
connection.

If your application scales by creating new processes, then you should pick
the `multi_process_optimized` config files. An example of this is an
event driven application that runs as a single thread in an event loop.
In this type of application it is usual for the application to create
at least one new process for each cpu core you want to utilize.

There are also similar config files for if you are using the event
driven polling feature of the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver.
Once you have decided which conf file you should use, or created your
own you should follow the procedure below to install it:

1. Follow the instructions in the:
   Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 89xx Series Software for Linux\* - Getting
   Started Guide (330750) - Section 3.4 Starting/Stopping the Acceleration
   Software.

   Intel&reg; Atom&trade; Processor C2000 Product Family for Communications
   Infrastructure Software - Getting Started Guide (333035) - Section 9.5
   Starting/Stopping the Acceleration Software.
   to stop the Acceleration Software.
2. Copy the appropriate `.conf` file to `/etc`
3. Follow the instructions in the:
   Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 89xx Series Software for Linux\* - Getting
   Started Guide (330750) - Section 3.4 Starting/Stopping the Acceleration
   Software.
   or
   Intel&reg; Atom&trade; Processor C2000 Product Family for Communications
   Infrastructure Software - Getting Started Guide (333035) - Section 9.5

```

## Troubleshooting

The most likely failure point is that the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
OpenSSL\* Engine is not loading successfully.
If this occurs some of the things to check are:

   1. Has the qat\_contig\_mem driver been loaded successfully? If not the
      engine will fail to initialise. Check by running `lsmod`, qat\_contig\_mem
      should be in the list. The same applies if using the alternative
      USDM component, but instead look for usdm_drv when running `lsmod`.
   2. Has the correct Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver config file
      been copied to `/etc`? Check it has a `[SHIM]` section and that the
      Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver software was restarted
      so that it picked up the new config file.
   3. Is the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver up and running?
      Check by running `lsmod`, icp_qa_al should be in the list.
      Also check the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver software
      has been started.
   4. Were the paths set correctly so the `qat.so` engine file
      was copied to the correct location?
      Check they really are there.
   5. Has the environment variable `OPENSSL_ENGINES` been correctly
      defined and exported to the shell?
      Also check it is really pointing to the correct location.

If running on a Debian\* based OS (Ubuntu\* for example) it is
possible that the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver userspace
shared library needed by the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
OpenSSL\* Engine may not be located even though it has been
installed. To resolve this it is recommended to add the /lib64
folder to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable as follows:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/lib64

If linking against the Upstream Intel&reg; Quickassist
Technology Driver then ensure that the mandatory parameter
`--enable-upstream_driver` has been specified when running
`./configure`, or the link will fail.

## Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine Specific Messages

OpenSSL\* engines support a mechanism whereby custom messages can be
defined for an application to communicate directly with the engine.
These messages are typically used in two ways:

   1. Firstly in order to set configuration options. These messages
      are typically sent before the engine is initialized. Sending
      these after initialization will typically have no effect.
   2. Secondly in order to control the engine operation. These
      messages may be sent before initialization or after or both.

The custom message mechanism passes a string to identify the
message, and uses a number of parameters to pass information into
or out of the engine. It is defined as follows:

    ENGINE_ctrl_cmd(<Engine>, <Message String>, <Param 3>,
                    <Param 4>, NULL, 0\)

Where:

   - &lt;Engine&gt; is a pointer to the Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology enabled
     OpenSSL\* Engine.
   - &lt;Message String&gt; is a string representing the message type.
   - &lt;Param 3&gt; is a long that can be used to pass a number, or a
     pointer can be cast to it.
   - &lt;Param 4&gt; is a void pointer used to pass data structures in.
   - The last 2 parameters are always NULL and 0 when used with
     the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine.

```text
Message String: ENABLE_EXTERNAL_POLLING
Param 3:        0
Param 4:        NULL
Description:
    This message is used to enable the external polling mode of operation where
    it becomes the applications responsibility to use the POLL message below to
    check for messages that have been returned from the hardware accelerator.
    It has no parameters or return value.  If required this message must be
    sent after engine creation and before engine initialization.

Message String: POLL
Param 3:        0
Param 4:        pointer to an int
Description:
    This message is used when external polling is enabled to request poll of
    all instances. The status of the request is passed back in the variable
    passed in as Param 4. This message may be sent at any time after engine
    initialization.

Message String: SET_INTERNAL_POLL_INTERVAL
Param 3:        unsigned long cast to a long
Param 4:        NULL
Description:
    This message is used to set the interval in nano seconds between polling
    for messages coming back from the hardware accelerator. The value should be
    passed in as Param 3. The default is 10,000, the min value is 1, and
    the max value is 10,000,000. This message can be sent at any time after
    the engine has been created.

Message String: SET_EPOLL_TIMEOUT
Param 3:        unsigned long cast to a int
Param 4:        NULL
Description:
    This message is used to set the timeout in milli seconds used for
    epoll_wait() when event driven polling mode is enabled. The value should be
    passed in as Param 3. The default is 1,000, the min value is 1, and the max
    value is 10,000. This message can be sent at any time after the engine
    has been created.

Message String: ENABLE_EVENT_DRIVEN_POLLING_MODE
Param 3:        0
Param 4:        NULL
Description:
    This message changes the engines mode to use the Intel&reg; Quickassist
    Technology Drivers event driven polling feature. It must be sent if
    required after engine creation but before engine initialization.  It should
    not be sent after engine initialization.

Message String: DISABLE_EVENT_DRIVEN_POLLING_MODE
Param 3:        0
Param 4:        NULL
Description:
    This message changes the engines mode to use the timer based polling
    feature.  It must be sent if required after engine creation but before
    engine initialization. It should not be sent after engine initialization.

Message String: GET_NUM_CRYPTO_INSTANCES
Param 3:        0
Param 4:        pointer to an int
Description:
    This message is used to retrieve the total number of crypto instances
    available as specified in the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver
    config file. The number of instances is assigned to the dereferenced int
    that is passed in as Param 4.  This message is used in conjunction with the
    GET_POLLING_FD message as in event driven polling mode with external
    polling there is an fd to listen to events on for each crypto instance.
    This message must be sent if required after the engine has been
    initialized.

Message String: GET_EXTERNAL_POLLING_FD
Param 3:        int cast to a long
Param 4:        pointer to an int
Description:
    This message is used to retrieve the file descriptor that can be used for
    event notification when the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver has
    had the event driven polling feature enabled. The value passed in as Param
    3 is the instance to retrieve the fd for. The fd is returned by assigning
    to the dereferenced int passed as Param4. When retrieving fd's it is usual
    to first request how many instances there are with the
    GET_NUM_CRYPTO_INSTANCES message and then use a for loop to iterate through
    the instances starting from 0 and use this message to retrieve the fd for
    each instance. This message must be sent if required after the engine has
    been initialized.

Message String: SET_INSTANCE_FOR_THREAD
Param 3:        long
Param 4:        NULL
Description:
    This message is used to bind the thread to a specific instance number.
    Param 3 contains the instance number to bind to. If required, the message
    must be sent after the engine creation and will automatically trigger the
    engine initialization.

Message String: GET_NUM_OP_RETRIES
Param 3:        0
Param 4:        pointer to an unsigned int
Description:
    This message returns the number of retry operations.  The number is set in
    the variable passed in as Param 4.  This message may be sent at any time
    after engine initialization.

Message String: SET_MAX_RETRY_COUNT
Param 3:        int cast to a long
Param 4:        NULL
Description:
    This message is used for synchronous operations to determine how many times
    the engine should retry a message before flagging a failure. The value
    should be passed in as Param 3. Setting the value to -1 results in infinite
    retries. The default is 5 and the max value is 100,000. This message can be
    sent at any time after the engine is created.

Message String: SET_CRYPTO_SMALL_PACKET_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD
Param 3:        0
Param 4:        string of cipher algorithm name and threshold value
Description:
    This message is used to set the threshold that determines the size crypto
    packets need to be before they are offloaded to the acceleration device.
    It is not efficient to offload very small packets to the accelerator as to
    do so would take longer to transfer the data to and from the accelerator
    than to encrypt/decrypt using the main CPU. The threshold value can be set
    independently for each EVP_CIPHER operation supported by the engine using
    the following names:
        AES-128-CBC-HMAC-SHA1
        AES-256-CBC-HMAC-SHA1
        AES-128-CBC-HMAC-SHA256

## Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\* Engine Build Options

The following is a list of the options that can be used with the
`./configure` command when building the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
OpenSSL\* Engine:

```
Mandatory

--with-qat_dir=/path/to/qat_driver
    Specify the path to the source code of the Intel&reg; Quickassist
    Technology Driver. This path is needed for compilation in order
    to locate the Intel&reg; Quickassist header files.
    If you do not specify this the build will fail.
    For example if using the QATL.2.6.0-60.tar.gz driver package
    that was unpacked to `/QAT`, and you are using an Intel&reg;
    Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series device then you
    would use the following setting:
    --with-qat_dir=/QAT/QAT1.6

--with-openssl_dir=/path/to/openssl
    Specify the path to the top level of the OpenSSL\* source code.
    This path is needed so that the compilation can locate the
    OpenSSL header files and also because the mkerr.pl script
    is needed from the OpenSSL source files in order to generate
    the engine specific error source files. If you do not specify
    this the build will fail.
    For example if you cloned the OpenSSL\* Github\* repository from
    within `/` then you would use the following setting:
    --with-openssl_dir=/openssl

--with-openssl_install_dir=/path/to/openssl_install
    Specify the path to the top level where the OpenSSL\* build was
    installed to. This is needed so that the qat.so engine library
    can be copied into the folder containing the other dynamic engines
    when you run 'make install'. If you do not specify this then
    'make install' will fail.
    For example if you installed OpenSSL to its default location of
    `/usr/local/ssl` then you would use the following setting:
    --with-openssl_install_dir=/usr/local/ssl

Mandatory (when using the Upstream Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
Driver)

--enable-upstream_driver/--disable-upsteam_driver
    Enable/Disable linking against the Upstream Intel&reg; Quickassist
    Technology Driver. If linking against the Upstream Intel&reg;
    Quickassist Driver then this option must be enabled (disabled by
    default).

Optional

--with-qat_build_dir=/path/to/qat_driver/build
    Specify the path to the location of the built Intel&reg;
    Quickassist Technology Driver library files. This path is needed
    in order to link to the userspace libraries of the Intel&reg;
    Quickassist Technology Driver. The default if not specified is to
    use the path specified by --with-qat_dir with '/build' appended.
    You only need to specify this parameter if the driver library
    files have been built somewhere other than the default.

--enable-usdm/--disable-usdm
    Enable/Disable compiling against the USDM component and that the
    link should be configured to link in the userspace library of the
    USDM component. The USDM component is a pinned contiguous memory
    driver that is distributed with the Upstream Intel&reg;
    Quickassist Technology Driver. It can be used instead of the
    supplied qat_contig_mem memory driver (disabled by default).

--with-usdm_dir=/path/to/usdm/directory
    Specify the path to the location of the USDM component.
    The default if not specified is to use the path specified by
    --with-qat_dir with '/quickassist/utilities/libusdm_drv' appended.
    You only only need to specify this parameter if using the USDM
    component, and if the path to it is different from the default.

--disable-qat_rsa/--enable-qat_rsa
    Disable/Enable Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
    RSA offload (enabled by default)

--disable-qat_dsa/--enable-qat_dsa
    Disable/Enable Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
    DSA offload (enabled by default)

--disable-qat_dh/--enable-qat_dh
    Disable/Enable Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
    DH offload (enabled by default)

--disable-qat_ecdh/--enable-qat_ecdh
    Disable/Enable Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
    ECDH offload (enabled by default)

--disable-qat_ecdsa/--enable-qat_ecdsa
    Disable/Enable Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
    ECDSA offload (enabled by default)

--disable-qat_ciphers/--enable-qat_ciphers
    Disable/Enable Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
    Chained Cipher offload (enabled by default)

--disable-qat_prf/--enable-qat_prf
    Disable/Enable Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
    PRF offload (enabled by default)

--disable-qat_small_pkt_offload/--enable-qat_small_pkt_offload
    Enable the offload of small packet cipher operations to Intel&reg;
    Quickassist Technology. When disabled, these operations are performed using
    the CPU (disabled by default).

--disable-qat_debug/--enable-qat_debug
    Disable/Enable debug output to aid debugging. Warning: This
    option should never be enabled in a production environment as
    it may output private key information to the console/logs and
    may also introduce side channel timing attack
    vulnerabilities (disabled by default).

--disable-qat_warnings/--enable-qat_warnings
    Disable/Enable warnings to aid debugging. Warning: This
    option should never be left on in a production environment
    as it may introduce side channel timing attack
    vulnerabilities (disabled by default).

--disable-qat_mem_debug/--enable-qat_mem_debug
    Disable/Enable debug output from the userspace memory management
    code to aid debugging. This option produces quite verbose output
    hence why it is separate to the standard debug. Warning: This
    option should never be enabled in a production environment as
    it may output private key information to the console/logs and
    may also introduce side channel timing attack
    vulnerabilities (disabled by default).

--disable-qat_mem_warnings/--enable-qat_mem_warnings
    Disable/Enable warnings from the userspace memory management code
    to aid debugging. Warning: This option should never be left on
    in a production environment as it may introduce side channel
    timing attack vulnerabilities (disabled by default).

--disable-multi_thread/--enable-multi_thread
    Disable/Enable an alternative way of managing within userspace the
    pinned contiguous memory allocated by the qat_contig_mem
    driver. This alternative method will give improved performance
    in a multi-threaded environment by making the slab pools
    thread local to avoid locking between threads. Although this
    can give better performance there are several drawbacks such
    as the memory slabs will be utilized less efficiently, and you
    cannot allocate in one thread and free in another thread.
    Running in this mode also does not support processes that
    fork (disabled by default).

--disable-qat_mux/--enable-qat_mux
    Disable/Enable support for building using the Mux mode of the
    Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology Driver. Mux mode allows you to
    mix Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 8900 to 8920 Series hardware
    and Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series hardware
    within the same system using a common driver interface. You
    should only specify this option if using a mixture of hardware
    (disabled by default).

--with-cc-opt="parameters"
    Sets additional parameters that will be added to the CFLAGS
    variable at compile time.

--with-ld-opt="parameters"
    Sets additional parameters that will be used during linking.
```

## Using the OpenSSL\* Configuration File to Load/Initialize Engines

OpenSSL\* includes support for loading and initializing engines via the
openssl.cnf file. The openssl.cnf file is contained in the `ssl`
subdirectory of the path you install OpenSSL\* to.
By default OpenSSL\* does not load the openssl.cnf file at initialization
time. In order to load the file you need to make the following function
call from your application as the first call to the OpenSSL\* library:

    OPENSSL_init_crypto(OPENSSL_INIT_LOAD_CONFIG, NULL);

The second parameter determines the name of the section containing the
application specific initialization settings. If you set the parameter
to NULL as in the example above it will default to look for the
`openssl_conf` section. If you want to use your own section you should
declare a structure of type `OPENSSL_INIT_SETTINGS` and set the `appname`
field to a string containing the section name you wish to use. The example
config file sections below assume you are using the default `openssl_conf`
section name.

If converting an existing application to use the Intel&reg; Quickassist
Technology OpenSSL\* Engine you may find that the application instead
makes the now deprecated call to:

    OPENSSL_config(NULL);

Where the parameter is a const char* pointer to the `appname` section
you want to use, or NULL to use the default `openssl_conf` section.

Currently this will give the same behaviour as the
`OPENSSL_init_crypto(OPENSSL_INIT_LOAD_CONFIG, NULL)` call but as it is
deprecated it should not be relied upon for future use.

For further details on using the OPENSSL_init_crypto
function please see the OpenSSL\* online documentation located at:
<https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/OPENSSL_init_crypto.html>

In order to start using the openssl.cnf file it needs some additional
lines adding. You should add the following statement in the global section
(this is the section before the first bracketed section header):

    openssl_conf = openssl_init

The string `openssl_init` is the name of the section in the configuration
file which describes the application specific settings. You do not need
to stick to the naming convention here if you prefer to use a different
name.

The `openssl_init` section can be located at the end of the global
section (as the first bracketed section), or further down the
configuration file. It should have the following added:

    [ openssl_init ]
    engines = engine_section

The `engines` string is a keyword that OpenSSL\* recognises as a
configuration module. It should be set to a string which is the
section name containing a list of the engines to be
loaded. So for the Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology OpenSSL\*
Engine the section should contain:

    [ engine_section ]
    qat = qat_section

The `qat_section` contains all the settings relating to that
particular engine. For instance it may contain:

    [ qat_section ]
    engine_id = qat
    dynamic_path = /usr/local/ssl/lib/engines_1_1/qat.so
    # Add engine specific messages here
    default_algorithms = ALL

Where `engine_id` specifies the name of engine to load (should be `qat`).

Where `dynamic_path` is the location of the loadable shared library
implementing the engine. There is no need to specify this line if the engine
is located within the standard path that OpenSSL\* was installed to.

Where `default_algorithms` specifies which algorithms supplied by the engine
should be used by default. Specify `ALL` to make all algorithms supplied
by the engine be used by default.

In addition the `qat_section` may contain settings that call custom
engine specific messages. For instance:

    ENABLE_EVENT_DRIVEN_MODE = EMPTY

is functionally equivalent of making the following engine specific
message function call:

    ENGINE_ctrl_cmd(e, "ENABLE_EVENT_DRIVEN_MODE", 0, NULL, NULL, 0);

You should set the setting to `EMPTY` if there are no parameters to pass,
or assign the value that would be passed as the 4th parameter of the
equivalent `ENGINE_ctrl_cmd` call. It should be noted that this mechanism
is only useful for passing simple values at engine initialization time.
You cannot pass 3rd parameter values, pass complex structures or deal
with return values via this mechanism.

Engine specific messages should be specified before the `default_algorithms`
setting or incorrect behaviour may result. The following messages are
supported:

* `ENABLE_EVENT_DRIVEN_POLLING_MODE`
* `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_POLLING`
* `SET_INTERNAL_POLL_INTERVAL`
* `SET_EPOLL_TIMEOUT`
* `SET_MAX_RETRY_COUNT`

In case of forking, the custom values are inherited by the child process.

By default the engine will get initialized at the end of this section (after
all the custom engine specific messages have been sent). This can be controlled
via an additional `init` setting that is out of scope of the documentation
here.

For further details on using the OpenSSL\* configuration file please
see the OpenSSL\* online documentation located at:
<https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/apps/config.html>

By setting up the configuration file as above it is possible for instance
to run the OpenSSL\* speed application to use the Intel&reg; Quickassist
Technology OpenSSL\* Engine without needing to specify `-engine qat` as
a command line option.

## Using the OpenSSL\* pipelining capability
The OpenSSL\* pipelining provides the capability to parallelise the
processing for a single connection. For example a big buffer to be
encrypted can be split into smaller chunks with each chunk encrypted
simultaneously using pipelining.  The Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology
OpenSSL\* Engine supports OpenSSL\* pipelining capability for chained
cipher encryption operations only. The engine provides a maximum of 32
pipelines (buffer chunks) with maximum size of 16,384 bytes for each
pipeline. When pipelines are used, they are always offloaded to the
accelerator ignoring the small packet offload threshold.  Please refer to
OpenSSL\* manual for more information about pipelining.
